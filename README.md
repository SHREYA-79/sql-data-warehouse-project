# sql-data-warehouse-project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!


## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **modern data warehouse** using **SQL Server** to consolidate sales data from multiple sources, ensuring high-quality, integrated, and well-documented data for analytical reporting. The goal is to enable **data-driven decision-making** through **SQL-based analytics**, providing insights into **customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends**.  

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Data Sources**  
- **Sales Transactions** (POS, E-commerce, CRM)  
- **Customer Data** (Demographics, Purchase History)  
- **Product Data** (Inventory, Categories, Pricing)  
- **External Data** (Market Trends, Competitor Benchmarks)  

### **2. Data Quality & Governance**  
- **Data Validation Rules** (Ensuring accuracy, completeness, consistency)  
- **Cleansing & Standardization** (Handling missing values, duplicates, formatting)  
- **Metadata Management** (Tracking data lineage, definitions, and transformations)  

### **3. Data Integration (ETL/ELT)**  
- **Staging Layer** (Raw data ingestion)  
- **Integration Layer** (Transformed, conformed dimensions)  
- **Dimensional Model** (Star Schema / Snowflake for analytics)  
- **Incremental Loading** (Efficient updates without full reloads)  

### **4. Scope**  
- **Data Warehouse Architecture** (OLAP vs. OLTP, Kimball vs. Inmon)  
- **SQL-Based Analytics** (Complex queries, aggregations, window functions)  
- **Performance Optimization** (Indexing, partitioning, query tuning)  

### **5. Documentation**  
- **Data Dictionary** (Table schemas, relationships, business definitions)  
- **ETL Process Flow** (Step-by-step transformations)  
- **Report Specifications** (Metrics, KPIs, visualization logic)  

## **Business Intelligence (BI) & Analytics:**  

### **Analytics & Reporting Objectives**  
- **Customer Behavior Analysis** (Lifetime value, segmentation, churn prediction)  
- **Product Performance** (Top-selling items, profitability, seasonality trends)  
- **Sales Trends** (Revenue by region, growth over time, sales funnel efficiency)  



### **Reporting Deliverables**  
- **Dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau for executive summaries)  
- **Ad-Hoc Query Support** (Self-service analytics for business teams)  
- **Automated Reports** (Scheduled PDF/Excel exports)
